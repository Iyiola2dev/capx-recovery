        Pretending to be crypto brokers, these scammers offer fake services to their victims. They provide fake reports on crypto profits, convincing victims that their trading platforms are making money. These false reports trick victims into investing more and more. When victims try to withdraw their earnings, scammers charge various taxes or deny their request completely.

        Scammers also offer to trade for their victims, but instead of looking out for their victimsâ€™ financial interests, these scammers trade recklessly.
